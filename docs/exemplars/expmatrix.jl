These examples use ArbNumerics v0.4.4, no earlier version supports `exp(matrix)`. 
So, either first do `pkg> up` or do `pkg> rm ArbNumerics` then `pkg> add ArbNumerics`.
Sometimes, rebuilding with `pkg> build ArbNumerics` cleans up after itself.
All the matrix handling is new code, the examples here are working as of now.
If you find anything unclear or something awry, post an issue and
please use slack's direct message to draw my attention.

ArbNumerics' interactive users see the "viewable precision"; computations utilize "working precision".
By definition, _viewable precision <= working_precision_. They may share the same number; then the
results shown are precisely the computed numerical results. Should they differ, there are "extra bits".
Julia should be restarted just before these precisions are altered.  When the precision is being altered
in the course of iterative refinement, it is the precision of successive values which moves, not their
bedrock relationship.  Individual values may be constructed more or less precisely than their sources.
Arithmetic over values of differing precision yields a result that adopts the lesser precision.
When the precision is lower than that which permits crisp numerical results, the interval known
to contain the actual result eclipses the magnitude of that value.  It appears so: `[+/- 12.1]`.
