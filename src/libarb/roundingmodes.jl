#=
    Specifies the rounding mode for the result of an approximate operation.
ARF_RND_NEAR   (4)
    Round to the nearest representable number, rounding to even if there is a tie.
ARF_RND_FLOOR  (2)
    Round to the nearest representable number in the direction towards minus infinity.
ARF_RND_CEIL   (3)
    Round to the nearest representable number in the direction towards plus infinity.
ARF_RND_DOWN   (0)
    Round to the nearest representable number in the direction towards zero.
ARF_RND_UP     (1)
    Round to the nearest representable number in the direction away from zero.
